### 4. Personal Information Takwimu Collects and How it is Used
As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow someone to identify you, including your name, email address, IP address, or other information from which someone could deduce your identity.

Takwimu collects and uses personal information in the following ways:

**4.1.  	Website Analytics:** When you visit our Websites and use our Services, Takwimu collects some information about your activities through tools such as Google Analytics. The type of information that we collect focuses on general information such as country or city where you are located, pages visited, time spent on pages, heat-map of visitors’ activity on the site, use and re-use of downloadable content, information about the browser you are using, etc. Takwimu collects and uses this information pursuant to our legitimate interest in enhancing the security and utility of our Services. The information we gather and process is used in the aggregate to spot trends without deliberately identifying individuals, except in cases where you engage in a transaction with Takwimu by donating money, purchasing services, or buying a ticket for an event or program. In those cases, Takwimu retains certain information about your visit to the Services pursuant to its legitimate interest in understanding its community of supporters and improving its Services, and this information is stored in connection with other personal information you provide to Takwimu.

Note that you can learn about Google’s practices in connection with its analytics services and how to opt out of it by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). If you would like to opt out of Takwimu’s analytics, please contact **hello@takwimu.africa** with your request.

**4.2.

Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or other Internet access device.  Cookies may enable us to personalize your experience on the Services, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer, and monitor advertisements and other activities.

**4.3. 	Registration, Support and Community Services:** When you register to obtain a user account on any of the Services, submit a support request or other enquiry, or contribute your own data or content, you will be asked to provide personal information to create your account and establish a password and profile. Takwimu collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in establishing and maintaining your account, interacting with you and and providing you with high quality services. We may also use your email address to contact you regarding changes to this policy or other applicable policies. The name or nickname you provide in connection with your account may be used to attribute you in connection with any content you submit to any Service. In addition, whenever you use a Takwimu Login Service to log into a Website or use the Services, our servers keep a plain text log of the Websites you visit and when you visit them.

**4.4. 	Events:** When you sign up for an event hosted or supported by Takwimu, you will be asked to provide some personal information, including your name, email address, and other information as needed. Takwimu collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in organizing and running the relevant event. We may share your personal information with vendors, third party contractors, partner organizations, and volunteers for the purpose of organizing and running the event and related activities.

**4.5.	Emails and Newsletters:** When you sign up to receive updates from Takwimu or otherwise subscribe to one of our mailing lists, you will be asked to provide some personal information. Takwimu collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in providing news and updates to, and collaborating with, its supporters and volunteers.

**4.6.	Email Analytics:** When you receive communications from Takwimu after signing up for the Takwimu newsletter, campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications from Takwimu, we use analytics to track whether you open the mail, click on the links, and otherwise interact with what we send. You may opt out of this tracking by choosing to get plain-text emails from Takwimu. Takwimu collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in understanding the interests of its community of supporters and volunteers in order to provide more relevant news and updates.

**4.7.	Social Media Analytics:** When you communicate with us or others via social media with reference to Takwimu or its Services or you share or publish Takwimu content online we use analytics to identify these conversations in the public domain so we can learn more about people’s interests in Takwimu content and services and use this information to improve our services.

**4.8	Other Voluntarily Provided Information:** When you provide feedback to Takwimu, sign a petition distributed by Takwimu, or otherwise submit personal information to Takwimu, Takwimu collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in better understanding our community of supporters and volunteers and in furtherance of the particular program or activity to which you provided feedback or other input.


### 5. Retention of Personal Information
The majority of the personal information collected and used as explained above is aggregated and stored in a central database provided by a third party service provider. Takwimu aggregates this data pursuant to its legitimate interest in having information stored in a single location to minimize complexity, increase consistency in internal practices, better understand its community of supporters and volunteers, and enhance the security of the data.  

Takwimu erases the web browser logs described above on a regular, rolling basis.

### 6. Access to Your Personal Information
You are generally entitled to access personal information that Takwimu holds and to have inaccurate data corrected or removed to the extent Takwimu still maintains it. In certain circumstances, you also may have the right to object for legitimate reasons to the processing or transfer of personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please write to **hello@takwimu.africa** explaining your request.

### 7. Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Takwimu does not disclose personal information to third parties except as specified elsewhere in this policy and in the following instances:
Takwimu may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to undertake the activities described in Paragraph 4.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy; © comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.


### 8. Security of Your Personal Information
Takwimu has implemented reasonable physical, technical, and organizational security measures for personal information that Takwimu processes against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in compliance with applicable law. However, no website can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If any data breach occurs, we will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Websites and comply with all other applicable data privacy requirements including, when required, personal notice to you if you have provided and we have maintained an email address for you.

The Takwimu Login Services account systems have security risks in addition to those described above. Among other things, they are vulnerable to DNS attacks, and using any Takwimu Login Service may increase the risk of phishing.

### 9. Children
Takwimu Services are not directed at children under the age of 18 and we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 18 without requiring parental consent. Our Terms of Use prohibit anyone using our Services from submitting any personally identifiable information about persons under 18 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to Takwimu through the Services represents that they are 18 years of age or older.

### 10. Third Party Service Providers
Takwimu uses many third party service providers in connection with the Services, including website hosting services, database management, credit card processing, and many more. Some of these service providers may place session cookies on your computer, and they may collect and store your personal information on our behalf in accordance with the data practices and purposes explained above in Paragraph 4.

### 11. Third Party Sites
The Services may provide links to a wide variety of third party websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.

### 12. Transferring Data to Other Countries
If you are accessing or using the Services in regions with laws governing data collection, processing, transfer and use, please note that when we use and share your data as specified in this policy, we may transfer your information to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.

The Services are currently hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom, which means your personal information may be located on servers in the United States and/or the United Kingdom. The majority of contractors that Takwimu is using as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy are located in the United States and in Canada, but this may change from time to time.

Data transferred from the European Union to the United States or outside the European Union will be made on the grounds of a certification to the E.U./U.S. Privacy Shield regime and/or a data transfer agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses approved of by the European Commission respectively, consistent with applicable data privacy requirements.

### 13. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will provide you with notice of such update through (at a minimum) a reasonably prominent notice on the Websites and Services, and will revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting, using, processing and transferring the personal information we collect.
